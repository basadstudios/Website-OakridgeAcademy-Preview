What began as a small school with just 50 students has grown into a thriving educational community serving hundreds of students from kindergarten through high school.\n\nOur founder, Dr. James Anderson, a renowned educator and educational psychologist, established Oakridge Academy based on the principle that education should nurture not just academic achievement, but also critical thinking, creativity, character, and social responsibility.\n\nOver the years, we have continuously evolved our educational approach, embracing innovative teaching methods, technology integration, and personalized learning paths. Our commitment to excellence has earned us recognition as one of the top educational institutions in the region.\n\nAt Oakridge Academy, we believe that education is a partnership between students, teachers, and parents.
